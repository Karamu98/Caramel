Navigate through the scene using WASD while holding right click on the game. Use Q and E to move up and down.

Top right menu shows you all the entities in the scene, use the select button next to each to view it's
components and adjustable properties in the window directly below.

Top left is the renderer options where values can be modifed and buffers can be viewed.

The "File" menu item allows you to add (not supported for assignment) and delete selected entities.
You can also enable/disable UI elements from in there aswell as close the program if you're in fullscreen.


"Prebuild" is a zipped build of my project at submission time, use this if there's complications with building.
